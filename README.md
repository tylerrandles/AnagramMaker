# AnagramMaker

Description

Anagrams, where you take the letters from one or more words and rearrange them to spell something else, are a fun word game

First you'll provide an integer (N) on a single line, this tells you how many lines to read. Then you'll be given a word (or words) on N lines to make anagrams for. Example:

1

Field of dreams
